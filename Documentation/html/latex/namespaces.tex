\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_command_lib}{Command\+Lib}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_command_lib}{Command\+Lib}} contains a set of classes that can be used to easily coordinate synchronous and asynchronous activities in complex ways. Most classes in this library inherit from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}}, which represents an action. Any \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}} can be run synchronously or asynchronously, and may be aborted }{\pageref{namespace_command_lib}}{}
