\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_command_lib}{Command\+Lib}} contains a set of classes that can be used to easily coordinate synchronous and asynchronous activities in complex ways. Most classes in this library inherit from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}}, which represents an action. Any \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}} can be run synchronously or asynchronously, and may be aborted.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_command_lib}{Command\+Lib}} contains a set of classes that can be used to easily coordinate synchronous and asynchronous activities in complex ways. Most classes in this library inherit from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}}, which represents an action. Any \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}} can be run synchronously or asynchronously, and may be aborted. 

Using \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_parallel_commands}{Parallel\+Commands}}, you can run a collection of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}} objects concurrently, and using \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_sequential_commands}{Sequential\+Commands}}, you can run a collection of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}} objects in sequence. Any command can be added to these two types (including \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_parallel_commands}{Parallel\+Commands}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_sequential_commands}{Sequential\+Commands}} themselves, because they are \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}} objects), so it\textquotesingle{}s possible to compose deep levels of coordinated activities. 

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_periodic_command}{Periodic\+Command}} repeats its action at a given interval, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_scheduled_command}{Scheduled\+Command}} runs once at a specific time, and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_recurring_command}{Recurring\+Command}} runs at times that are provided via a callback. 

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_retryable_command}{Retryable\+Command}} provides the option to keep retrying a failed command until the caller decides enough is enough, and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_time_limited_command}{Time\+Limited\+Command}} fails with a timeout exception if a given duration elapses before the command finishes execution. 

All of the above \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}} classes are simply containers for \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}} objects that presumably do something of interest. It is expected that users of this library will create their own \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}}-\/derived classes. 

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command_dispatcher}{Command\+Dispatcher}} manages asynchronous execution of dynamically generated commands. 

Documentation for \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_async_command}{Async\+Command}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_sync_command}{Sync\+Command}} should be read before developing a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_command_lib_1_1_command}{Command}}-\/derived class. 

Windows implementations must be careful when specifying durations. The implementations of various routines in \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_command_lib}{Command\+Lib}} make use of std\+::condition\+\_\+variable\+\_\+any. In my experience, Windows systems will not behave properly if you pass a value that equates to more milliseconds than can fit into the max value of a Windows DWORD (which is under a month long duration). This could be considered a bug in std\+::condition\+\_\+variable\+\_\+any. I have done nothing to work around it, so for now, it\textquotesingle{}s up to users of this library to be aware of this.
